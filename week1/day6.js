//WEEK 1

// DAY 6 - W, 9/15 - Largest numbers in Arrays

// Challenge: Return an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array. 

//My logic (pseudocode): 
//Create a function that takes in an array 
    //[[4,5,1], [13,2,7], [9,10,1], [500,5,33]]
//Assign a variable to an empty array that will hold the largest numbers
//Apply a for loop to iterate through the array 
//add a conditional to extract the largest number in each array[i]
//push the longest numbers into the empty array
